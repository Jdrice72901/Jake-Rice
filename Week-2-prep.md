Data mining to me is about finding patterns, correlations, and insights from datasets otherwise too large for a human to look at at gain anything from. By using statistical modeling, I can create infrances about trends and predict outcomes. Such as in Fraud detection, healthcare, court systems, and even en ecosystems. 
The pipeline used for data mining is the OSEMN Pipeline
O- Obtain Data
S- Scrubbing/ cleaning data
E-Exploring/Visualizing data
M- Modeling data
N- Interpreting Data
Defining the problem upfront is key to successful data analysis. It sets clear objectives and boundaries, ensuring that every step, from data collection to processing and analysis, stays focused on the projectâ€™s goals. This clarity helps you choose the right methods, gather relevant data, and establish criteria for measuring success.
Cleaning data is a very important step. Without this, every statistical test will be innacurate, non of your findings will be true, and nobody will take dyour data sets, or research with any credit. CLenaing outliers, null data points, and irelevent data can make your work easier for others to dublicate and analyze.
