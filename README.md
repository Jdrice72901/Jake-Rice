I am a data science student in my final year of undergrad. I wish to apply what I have learned in a meaningful way that can impact the world. I would love to work in agrigculture or in forestry, but am open to many other paths. In my free time from school I love to disc golf! I have been playing for 9 years, 4 of which have been profesionally. I dont make much money but just enough to keep the dream alive and keep me coming back for more.
